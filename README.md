## Introduction

> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in translating natural language questions about
> relational databases into SQL queries. In particular, test-time scaling techniques such as Self-Consistency and
> Self-Correction can enhance SQL generation accuracy by increasing computational effort during inference. However,
> these
> methods have notable limitations: Self-Consistency may select suboptimal outputs despite majority votes, while
> Self-Correction typically addresses only syntactic errors. To leverage the strengths of both approaches, we propose
> CSC-SQL, a novel method that integrates Self-Consistency and Self-Correction. CSC-SQL selects the two most frequently
> occurring outputs from parallel sampling and feeds them into a merge revision model for correction. Additionally, we
> employ the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to fine-tune both the SQL generation and revision
> models
> via reinforcement learning, significantly enhancing output quality. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness and
> generalizability of CSC-SQL. On the BIRD development set, our 3B model achieves 65.28% execution accuracy, while the
> 7B
> model achieves 69.19%. The code will be open sourced at https://github.com/CycloneBoy/csc_sql.
